# Prompt 5: Critical Computation

> The best way to understand how a text works, I argue, is to change it: to play around with it, to intervene in it in some way...

> Rob Pope, _Textual Intervention_

> Language makes three-quarters of your writing decisions for you. Not only to the letters observe preferred frequencies, they keep preferred company...The most common digram in English is "he"; you will find it three times in the sentence you are reading now.

## Readings

### Theory

### Practice

* [Chain of Thought Prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot)

## Summary

The feeling one gets from much of the experimentation we've read and completed so far this semester is one of somewhat light-hearted whimsy. This week, we engage with texts in ways that will push the envelope of _what computation does_.

## Goals

* Elaborate our understanding of code as an expressive medium by supplementing it with code as a _critical_ medium
* Examine ways to use code as a critical device, uncovering and foregrounding the experiences hidden in language
* Begin an engagement with conceptual practice; that is, developing larger-order concepts and using code to achieve them
* Practice approaching works with a critical lens that describes code and its creations

## Outcomes

* a critical text work which is:
  * applied on a source text
  * the product of a GPT-based chain of thought prompt that has a critical relationship to the source text

### Critical text work

_Procedural note: place code in `main.py` (prompt must be modified from the default); output should go in [writing/text.md](writing/text.md)_

Your goal is to find an available source text and develop a Python script that interacts with the GPT API to critically transform the text using a "chain of thought" prompting approach. Instead of writing your own Python algorithm to analyze the text, you will prompt GPT to generate a chain of thought analysis that guides it through transforming the source text in a meaningful way. This should involve multiple steps in reasoning that reflect a critical relationship to the text, revealing hidden nuances or deconstructing its structure.
